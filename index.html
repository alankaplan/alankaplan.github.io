<p>Tailoring medical treatment to individual needs requires an understanding of treatment heterogeneity. Many of the answers to this problem lie within existing medical record databases. In my research, I develop probabilistic machine learning methods to model clinical datasets. These methods work with datasets that contain significant missing values, heterogeneous data types, and longitudinal sequences. For Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), we formulated a modeling approach based on mixtures of distributions to subtype classes of injury. This approach quantifies phenotypes associated with each patient subtype, and improves specificity of outcome prediction. Intensive care datasets contain high sample rate data that can be described in several sequences of varying length. We developed a model formulation that characterizes subtypes in this setting. This model allows for irregularly samples sequences of different lengths and can be used to subtype patients and predict future outcomes. In the outpatient settings, very long sequences of clinical data elements are recorded. The temporal effect can vary depending on the measure and time difference between measurements. I developed an approach that models time-dependent bivariate distributions and applied this approach to data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).</p>

<p>My work in computational aspects of neuroscience includes the development of statistical models for Electrocorticography (ECoG). We study the correlates between ~100 sensor arrays implanted intracranially in human patients undergoing preoperative epilepsy monitoring and video cues of emotional affect. This work addresses the question of discovering quantitative biomarkers linking brain activity with underlying emotion and mood. The developed approaches utilize time-frequency decompositions of the ECoG signals and are capable of producing spatial maps which indicate the level of discriminability with respect to emotional affect.</p>

<h3 id="pulse-shape-discrimination">Pulse shape discrimination</h3>
<p>Detailed signals acquired from scintillator devices can be used to distinguish nuclear particles, such as neutrons and gammas. In the low energy regime, standard heuristic approaches often fail to correctly classify particle type. I developed techniques leveraging statistical modeling approaches to enable more accurate classification for lower particle energies. The models are based on partially observed ground truth (labels) for each pulse that is recorded and consist of mixtures of unknown Gaussian templates. We implemented and brought the software design of the required algorithms to a high level of software engineering, including a fast FPGA implementation.</p>

<h3 id="computer-vision-applications">Computer vision applications</h3>
<p>In our work, we design and implement computer vision techniques to a variety of areas. In one work, we use a convolutional neural network to detect emotional affect in facial imagery. As in many computer vision problems, the availability of training data with ground truth labels is a limiting factor. There, we leverage a large dataset without ground truth labels and show improvement in performance in the data of interest. In another area, we developed methods for quality control in advanced manufacturing processes. We implemented a real-time system to detect flaws in a microencapsulation system. Our classification algorithm actuated a valve that improved the quality of resulting microcapsules in real-time. Using similar techniques, we developed methods for identifying flaws in 3-D printing systems. In the area of medical imaging, we developed an approach for representation learning that spatially corresponds across images.</p>

<h3 id="cardiovascular-biometrics">Cardiovascular biometrics</h3>
<p>Cardiovascular activity can be measured noninvasively and with noncontact sensors. Electrical activity can be recorded using the traditional Electrocardiogram (ECG) setup, but hemodynamics can also be captured in the mechanical domain. We developed the use of Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV), which can be used to measure surface vibrations, for remote sensing of cardiovascular activity. We designed and implemented models and associated algorithms for LDVs signals acquired from the skin overlying the carotid artery. These signals can be acquired in a noncontact and standoff manner and they represent underlying hemodynamics in the carotid. The models capture varying scales of temporal dynamics reflected in the signal. At the lowest level, millisecond level dynamics due to the underlying blood pressure are observed. At the next level, cardiorespiratory effects alter the shape of the pulse across heartbeat. At the higher levels, changes occurring on longer times scales were considered. This work enables the use of the LDV in clinical settings where skin contact is either unavailable or undesirable, such as the case with MRI gating or neonatal patients. In addition to LDV, we also performed a comparative analysis of methods for biometric identity verification using traditional Electrocardiogram data.</p>
